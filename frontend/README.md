## Pages

1. **Landing Page** (`/`): Hero section with feature cards
2. **Authentication** (`/auth`): Sign up and login with toggle animation
3. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): Input form for location, crop type, and image upload
4. **Results** (`/results`): Crop analysis results with health score and recommendations
5. **Insights** (`/insights`): Dataset information and feature insights with charts

## Mock Data

The application uses mock data for demonstration purposes. All data is generated client-side and stored in localStorage. The structure is designed to easily integrate with a real backend API.

## Design Philosophy

- **Clean & Minimal**: No unnecessary elements, focus on content
- **Earthy Colors**: Agricultural theme with greens, browns, and soft grays
- **Subtle Animations**: Smooth, realistic micro-interactions
- **Professional**: Production-ready UI suitable for investor demos

## Future Backend Integration

The codebase is structured to easily integrate with a backend API:

- Replace mock data functions in `mockData.js` with API calls
- Update authentication logic in `App.jsx` to use real auth endpoints
- Connect image upload in `Dashboard.jsx` to file upload API
- Replace localStorage with API calls for results storage
